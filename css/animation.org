    Initial value	as each of the properties of the  shorthand:

    animation-name: none
    animation-duration: 0s
    animation-timing-function: ease
    animation-delay: 0s
    animation-iteration-count: 1
    animation-direction: normal
    animation-fill-mode: none
    animation-play-state: running
    //handy
    animation: [name] [duration]
#+END_EXAMPLE

** transform

** transition
   If you want add transition between normal state and hover or focus state, then add the transition property in **normal** state.
#+BEGIN_SRC css
  input{
    border-style:solid;
    border-color:red;
    transition: border-color 1s;
  }
  input:focus{
      border-color:green;
  }
#+END_SRC
   Then there will have transition both on focus and lose focus.
   And for sure you can add another transition to make different effect between two states.

*** transition-duration
    The property `transition-duration` can used not only when explicitly declared the transition, but also there are two state to transist between.
    Like a normal and hover state, you could just write:
#+BEGIN_SRC css
  .class{
      transition-duration: 1s;
  }
  .class:hover{
     skdfjks: sd;

  }
#+END_SRC
That will constraint the duration time when hover the element.
*Tips*:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- The `transition-duration` is the time from other state to this state.
- See a detail in [[http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_buttons_animate2][button animation]].
