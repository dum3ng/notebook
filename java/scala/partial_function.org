** 1 Make a partially applied function
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  def part(x:Int, y:Int, z:Int) = x+y+z

  def part1 = part(x:Int,3,_:Int)

  def part2 = part(_:Int, _:Int, 10)
#+END_SRC

Note that you can arbitrarily apply any or some number of parameters in different position.

** 2 Use currying

You can directly define curried function:
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  def curry(x:Int)(y:Int) = x*y

  val double = curry(2)
#+END_SRC

Or you can make a normal function to curried:
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
    def normal(x:Int, y:Int) = x*y

    val curry = normal.curried

    val tripple = curry(3)
#+END_SRC

-----
Both way have their goods. Choose by the situation.
