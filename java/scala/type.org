** type

Take type *T'* as the subclass of *T*, then question is what is the class hierachy between *C[T]* and *C[T']*.
In scala you can add

-----

- Covariant: - C[T'] is a subclass of C[T] - Scala notation: [+T]

- Contravariant: - C[T] is a subclass of C[T'] - Scala notation: [-T]

- Invariant: - C[T] and C[T'] are not related - Scala notation: [T]
